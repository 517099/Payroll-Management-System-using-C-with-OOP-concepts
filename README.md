# Objective;

According to the system's own description, a payroll management system is an accounting package that provides financial solutions for a specific organization or institutional body.Using predefined rules based on the organization's working pattern, this payroll management aids account maintenance of all records.Its admin module was built in a way that makes it possible to change the working rules at any time to meet the needs of the business.Its fixed automatic rates and salary save time when creating the final ledger.The generation module will prepare the employee's post and final reports; the administrator will only need to fill in the employee's details and select their work type in the database.Coding's usability can be easily achieved because it was developed using object-oriented programming principles.Changes to the working rules can be made by a technical person in a matter of seconds, even if they are required in the future.In order to access the specific data, all working departments within the organization will share a common file, eliminating the possibility of data duplication and contributing to data consistency.Only options can be selected for each working section, and the system's graphical user interface sets it apart from other systems.

# Existing System;

The user interface is the most problematic aspect of the system because of the complex business rules that make it difficult for users to use.Even if errors occur while working with the system, they are not receiving assistance on how to deal with them.It wasn't easy to keep track of employees' records, and when final payroll records were made, each employee had to be sorted by job category.The company's accounting module must use the tally package to retrieve information for the purpose of creating pay slips for each employee.

# Proposed System;

For making ledger, it will takes inputs on employees working modules such as type of work, their designation, rate per day, tax deduction on monthly basis and bonus or increment on fixed interval of days etc. As salary statement and payment sheet need to be prepared as and when required so each employees will be differentiated using their employee’s id. Pay slip will give the entire information which help the working employees to get clear picture for their salary and creating a fair environment for working organization
