# Payroll-Management-System-using-C++-with-OOP-concepts

# Abstract

This project is a pattern challenge that helps you to check your mastery in tracking and dealing with employees’ payroll topics for any company. This is useful for economic control and companies. The challenge has extraordinary training and subclasses with numerous functions in them.The mission has a couple of training and sub-training with many functions inside them.

Besides these, payroll control additionally lets in customers to print the income slip for a selected worker. This mission is large, whole and we attempted our pleasant to make it error-free. The supply code could be very long – over 1500 traces and evolved in Code Blocks compile
